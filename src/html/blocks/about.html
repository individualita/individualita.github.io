                Hello! I'm Roman, and I turned a simple interest in programming into a passion. Now I can do it constantly, finding joy in each new challenge. Every task presents an opportunity not only to apply my skills but also to learn something new.

                However, my growth doesn't stop at technical skills. I place great importance on effective communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. I understand that success in any project relies not only on technical expertise but also on the ability to collaborate and adapt.
